# Artificial Intelligence - Project

## Application of Genetic Algorithms in the Knapsack Problem

### 1. Project Description

The aim of the project is to implement a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the knapsack problem. The knapsack problem involves selecting specific items in such a way that their total value is maximized while the sum of their weights does not exceed the specified capacity of the knapsack.

### 2. Project Tasks

#### (a) Chromosome Structure Implementation

Define the structure of a chromosome representing the solution to the knapsack problem.

#### (b) Population Creation

Create a random population of chromosomes representing different sets of items in the knapsack.

#### (c) Fitness Function

Implement a fitness function that evaluates each solution in terms of its value and compliance with the knapsack constraints (total weight).

#### (d) Selection

Select parents for crossover based on the fitness function. You can use selection methods such as roulette, ranking, or tournament.

#### (e) Crossover

Perform the crossover operation on pairs of parents to obtain offspring. You can implement various crossover methods.

#### (f) Mutation

Introduce random changes in the offspring to maintain diversity in the population.

#### (g) Genetic Algorithm

Implement the main loop of the genetic algorithm, in which you repeat the operations of selection, crossover, and mutation over a certain number of generations.

#### (h) Result

Record the best solution found by the genetic algorithm.

#### (i) Tools and Programming Language Selection

Choose the tools and programming language for implementing the genetic algorithm. You can select any programming language, but you cannot use ready-made libraries for solving the knapsack problem.

#### (j) Report

Prepare a report on the progress of the project. Briefly describe the problems encountered and their solutions at each stage of the GA.

### 3. Test Data Set

For testing the genetic algorithm in solving the knapsack problem, you can use a sample data set that includes the values and weights of the items and the capacity of the knapsack. Here is a sample data set:

- Item values: [60, 100, 120, 50, 60, 30, 70, 110, 130, 60, 90, 40, 80, 90, 110, 120, 50, 100, 30, 70]
- Item weights: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 10, 60, 70, 80, 20, 30, 15, 25, 35, 40, 45, 10, 30, 15, 25]
- Knapsack capacity: 250

### 4. Submission Format
